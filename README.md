# Expensar App to track your expense

Built in Kotlin using modern architecture components(mvvm architecture pattern).


## Develop :heart_on_fire:

My Expense Tracker is built following MVVM design pattern and using the following components:

- [Kotlin]() - Android's official programming language.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room?hl=en) - SQLite object mapping library.
- [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/datastore?hl=en) -  DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally.
- [Jetpack Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) - Navigation library to ensure consistent and predictable user experience.
- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - Design pattern for asynchronous code execution.
- [Android Architecture Components ](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture) - Collection of libraries that contains the lifecycle-aware components.
